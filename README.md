# debug-graph

##Â TODO: 
- Add section support


### TODO Minimal version: 
- Proper collapse support
- Prefix/suffix support
- Feature parity with DebugGraph
- Dynamic y-axis which follows the value by decaying min/max towards the current value but not exceeding some minimum distance
- Initial min/max values on first update configurable
- Support fill-to-zero so the graph is inverted if drawing a negative value
