# debug-graph

##Â TODO: 
- Add section support
- Support collapsing graphs properly and option for initial collapse state


- Dynamic y-axis which follows the value by decaying min/max towards the current value but not exceeding some minimum distance
- Initial min/max values on first update configurable
- Support fill-to-zero so the graph is inverted if drawing a negative value
